### Frontend Architecture (React.js)
The user interface is built with React 18 and styled using Tailwind CSS, creating a modern, responsive experience that works seamlessly across devices.

**Key Frontend Components:**
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks (useState) to manage application state including user inputs, loading states, and nutrition results
- **API Integration**: Implements async/await patterns for smooth communication with the backend
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific styling for optimal viewing on all devices
- **Interactive Elements**: Real-time health score visualization, animated loading states, and smooth transitions

### Backend Architecture (FastAPI)
The backend is built with FastAPI, providing both high performance and automatic API documentation. The architecture is modular and extensible.

**Core Backend Modules:**

1. **AI Model Integration** (`ai_model.py`): Handles all OpenAI GPT-4 interactions with sophisticated prompt engineering for accurate nutrition analysis

2. **Nutrition Calculator** (`nutrition_calculator.py`): Implements advanced algorithms for parsing AI responses, calculating health scores, and generating dietary recommendations

3. **Meal Planner** (`meal_planner.py`): Provides goal-based meal planning with support for various dietary objectives like weight loss, muscle gain, and heart health

4. **API Endpoints** (`index.py`): RESTful API design with comprehensive error handling and data validation

### Database and Knowledge Management
The application uses a hybrid approach combining AI-generated insights with curated nutritional databases:

- **Verified Food Database**: Contains accurate nutritional profiles for common foods

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Let me walk you through setting up this application step by step, explaining each component as we go.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have these tools installed. Each serves a specific purpose in our development environment:

- **Node.js (16+)**: Powers our React frontend and manages JavaScript dependencies
- **Python (3.8+)**: Runs our FastAPI backend and AI processing components
- **OpenAI API Key**: Provides access to GPT-4 for nutrition analysis

### Step 1: Project Setup

First, let's get the codebase and prepare our development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ai-nutrition-analyzer

# Install Python dependencies for the backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

The application requires an OpenAI API key to function. Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your credentials:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is already configured to exclude it.

### Step 3: Running the Development Environment

Our application has two main components that need to run simultaneously:

**Start the Backend Server:**
```bash
# Navigate to the API directory
cd api

# Start the FastAPI server with auto-reload for development
uvicorn index:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Start the Frontend Development Server:**
```bash
# In a new terminal, from the project root
npm start
```

Your application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (React development server)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI with automatic documentation at /docs)

## üéØ Core Features Explained

Let me explain each feature and how it benefits users in their nutrition journey.

### Intelligent Food Analysis

When a user enters a food item, the application follows this sophisticated process:

1. **Input Validation**: Checks that the input appears to be a valid food item
2. **Database Lookup**: First searches our curated database of verified nutritional information
3. **AI Enhancement**: If not found locally, queries GPT-4 with carefully crafted prompts for accurate nutritional data
4. **Data Processing**: Parses the AI response using advanced regex patterns to extract structured nutritional values
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validates the extracted data for reasonableness and completeness

### Advanced Health Scoring Algorithm

The health scoring system uses a weighted approach that considers multiple nutritional factors:

```python
# Simplified version of our scoring algorithm
def calculate_health_score(nutrition_values):
    score = 0
    
    # Protein scoring (25% weight) - supports muscle health
    protein_score = min(25, protein_grams * 2.5)
    
    # Fiber scoring (25% weight) - promotes digestive health
    fiber_score = min(25, fiber_grams * 2.5)
    
    # Additional factors: healthy fats, vitamins, low sugar, low sodium
    # Each contributes to the final score out of 100
    
    return min(score, 100)
```

### Personalized Meal Recommendations

The meal planning system analyzes the nutritional profile of each food and suggests complementary ingredients:

- **High-protein foods**: Paired with complex carbohydrates and vegetables
- **High-fiber foods**: Combined with healthy fats for better nutrient absorption
- **Seasonal considerations**: Recommends foods that are fresh and in season
